OpenAI launches GPT-5 with new features
OpenAI releases GPT-5, which merges flagship and reasoning models. It automatically directs user queries to the appropriate model via the ChatGPT interface.

GPT-5 launch video performance charts criticized
The performance charts presented during the GPT-5 launch are deemed confusing, leading to speculation that GPT-5 may have generated them.

Access to GPT-5 may vary for users
While GPT-5 is available to all users through the ChatGPT web interface, nonpaying users might face wait times before they can access the new model.

Prompt of the Week
Title: Mastering Prompting for GPT-5: Techniques for Better Outputs
- Role/Task/Data separation
  Why: Clearly defining roles and expectations helps the model understand context and focus on delivering relevant responses.
  Template: As a [role], your task is to [task]. Use the following data: [data].
  Example: As a financial analyst, your task is to summarize the quarterly earnings report. Use the following data: Q3 2023 earnings increased by 15%.
- Constraint Specification
  Why: Setting specific constraints narrows the focus, guiding the model to produce more precise and relevant outputs.
  Template: Generate a summary of [topic] in no more than [number] words.
  Example: Generate a summary of the new GPT-5 features in no more than 100 words.
- Uncertainty Handling
  Why: Explicitly asking the model to acknowledge uncertainty encourages it to provide qualified answers rather than definitive statements.
  Template: Given the uncertainty about [topic], provide possible outcomes or scenarios.
  Example: Given the uncertainty about user access to GPT-5, provide possible outcomes for nonpaying users.
- Evaluation Criteria
  Why: Defining evaluation criteria allows the model to assess its own responses against established standards.
  Template: Evaluate the following response based on [criteria]: [response].
  Example: Evaluate the following response based on clarity and accuracy: 'GPT-5 offers improved reasoning capabilities.'
- Schema-Guided Outputs
  Why: Providing a structured output format helps the model organize information logically, enhancing clarity and usability.
  Template: List the features of [topic] in the following format: 1. Feature 1; 2. Feature 2; 3. Feature 3.
  Example: List the features of GPT-5 in the following format: 1. Enhanced reasoning; 2. Improved accuracy; 3. Multi-domain capabilities.
- Few-Shot Contrast
  Why: Providing contrasting examples helps the model learn the nuances of desired outputs, improving its ability to generalize.
  Template: Here are examples of good and bad responses: Good: [good example]. Bad: [bad example]. Now provide a response for [task].
  Example: Here are examples of good and bad responses: Good: 'GPT-5 improves reasoning.' Bad: 'GPT-5 is not good.' Now provide a response for explaining GPT-5's launch.
